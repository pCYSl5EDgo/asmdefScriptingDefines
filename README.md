# asmdef Scripting Defines

`asmdef Scripting Defines` is an Unity Editor Extension that let you add/remove `Scripting Define Symbols` to/from each of the `Assembly Definition`s separately.

This repository consists of three C# projects.

 - asmdefDefineSymbols 
 - asmdefDefineSymbols.Editor
 - asmdefScriptingDefines.Extension

# Environemnts

 - **Required** : .NET Core 2.1 or above
 - **Supported** : Unity 2018.4

# Background

`Scripting Define Symbols` of Unity Editor PlayerSettings are per platform settings.<br/>
Sometimes I want to add custom `Scripting Define Symbols` to the specific `Assembly Definition File` not to the entire Unity project.

# How to use

If you do not want to build whole solution for yourself. Go to [BOOTH](https://pcysl5edgo.booth.pm/items/1756645) and Buy it with 900 Japanese yen.
